# Copilot Native
The native client is a wrapper around the Copilot website to give us additional support for persistent OBS sockets for customers as a native application, and deeper browser control.

## Features
For subscribed users on Copilot's broadcaster plan, this application will provide additional support to: 
- [x] Background OBS support for infringement muting
- [x] Background alerts for infringement muting

... with more features planned for the future.

## Installation
Download the latest release from the [release section](https://github.com/copilotgg/native/releases). You can either download the program as a portable zip file, or install it as software. We automatically check for updates on launch, and may require you to update the application to use some services when new releases are made.

## Bug Reporting and Support
Please use the issues tracker, or speak to us on the subscriber Discord for paid feture enquiries.
